## Photo Requirements
- Format: JPG, PNG, or WebP
- Recommended size: 200x200 pixels or larger (square aspect ratio preferred)
- File size: Keep under 500KB per image for optimal loading
- If a photo is not available, the component will automatically fall back to showing initials

## How it works
The component will automatically load photos based on the filename. If a photo fails to load or doesn't exist, it will gracefully fall back to displaying the team member's initials in a colored circle.
